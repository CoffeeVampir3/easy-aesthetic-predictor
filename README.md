## How to use:

Temporary instructions: Use the included gradio demo, it will automatically download pretrained weights from <https://huggingface.co/Blackroot/Anime-Aesthetic-Predictor-Medium/tree/main> for you to try. You can rip the inference code out of the gradio demo and use it in any python script or whatever, feel free.

## Training:

See the wiki, it's designed to be pretty easy. You do need a GPU to train. https://github.com/CoffeeVampir3/easy-aesthetic-predictor/wiki
